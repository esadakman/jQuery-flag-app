# jQuery-flag-app

## Objective

- In order to improve my knowledge of jQuery, which I have been trying to learn recently, I tried to do the Flag App project, which I had done with Vanilla Javascript, this time with jQuery.

## Description

- In this project I made a simple Flag App with jQuery.
- After selecting the country from the dropdown list, you can see the relevant country's flag, capital, region, language and currency information.
- I use fetch API for getting data from `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all` and Bootstrap 5 for styling .
